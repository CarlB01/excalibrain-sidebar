This could be a side project. 

# about
I´d like to fill the _waiting time_ by shuffling around code within the excalibrain to see what happens. 

As [@zsviczian](https://twitter.com/zsviczian) himself stated in this [twitter/x post](https://x.com/zsviczian/status/1834485660566052940?s=20) in september 2024, ExcaliBrain is by him regarded as a "stop-gap solution", by that i suppose he means that the use of [obsidian dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [obsidian excalidraw](https://excalidraw-obsidian.online/Welcome) within obsidian itself shouldn't be regarded as the final solution. 

So there the development goes into _maintenance_. Neither of the implied parties has the time to develop the idea, at least not until the base app is stable enough.

But what a beauty excalibrain is. And even then, as Zsolt points out in his tweet, "it does not even come close to the beauty and elegance of [TheBrain's graph](https://www.thebrain.com)" where the idea of the visual node display seems to have originated. 

# references
ExcaliBrain is inspired by [TheBrain](https://www.thebrain.com) and [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs). 

Then multiple mentions of [excalibrain](https://github.com/zsviczian/excalibrain) in his [Sketch your mind](https://www.amazon.com/Sketch-Your-Mind-Nurture-Creative-ebook) book.

This is a thread that sheds some light.

several parallel developers. Perhaps look at this?

What is 'React' (built _natively_) ?

# Prerequisites
ExcaliBrain is built on top of [Dataview](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview) and [Excalidraw](https://github.com/zsviczian/obsidian-excalidraw-plugin). You must have both these plugins installed and enabled for ExcaliBrain to work.

ExcaliBrain is optimized to work well with [Hover Editor](https://github.com/nothingislost/obsidian-hover-editor).
